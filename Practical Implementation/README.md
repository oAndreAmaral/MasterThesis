### Preliminary Dataset

This [dataset](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/MasterThesis/blob/f382122ac101e8043d407242a48787a5367559b0/Practical%20Implementation/simulation_data_cleaned.csv) was used to train the first model. It is the result of SPICE simulation of an Amplifier and pre-processed using this [data file](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/MasterThesis/blob/f382122ac101e8043d407242a48787a5367559b0/Practical%20Implementation/Data%20Analysis.ipynb).

### Preliminary LSTM Application

This [model file](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/MasterThesis/blob/f382122ac101e8043d407242a48787a5367559b0/Practical%20Implementation/LSTM_Preliminary_Model.ipynb) contains the LSTM model, how to train the model and how to evaluate the performance.

### Preliminary MLP Application

Just to compare the performance of two different models in the same dataset, a [multi-layer perceptron model](https://github.com/oAndreAmaral/MasterThesis/blob/f382122ac101e8043d407242a48787a5367559b0/Practical%20Implementation/MLP%20Method.ipynb) was created, trained and evaluated.

### Conclusions

In this work the LSTM methodology was adopted.
