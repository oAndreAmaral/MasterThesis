# MasterThesis - Implementation Work
## Deep Neural Networks for Behavioral Modeling of Analog ICs

This repository aims to store all the information about modeling the behavior of analog circuits.

All this work is of the authorship of **Andr√© Carneiro Amaral**

A LSTM Model is implemented to modelate the behavior of an amplifier taking in consideration different dimensions of the devices.
